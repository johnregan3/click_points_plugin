# Click Points Plugin

Introduction

The Click Points Plugin is a WordPress novelty designed to display the author's abilities much more than it is to actually be useful.  The premise of the plugin is to claim virtual Rewards by completing events (clicking buttons) to earn Points.  The events are buttons displayed in a sidebar widget.  When clicked, the buttons award points to the user, along with a funny little message explaining why they got the points.  Points totals can be viewed on a User Points Page (generated via shortcode), including a listing of the ways the points were earned.  Finally, points can be redeemed for imaginary Rewards on a Rewards Page (again, generated via shortcode).  

It is my hope that Click Points will help you get a feel for my experience level, and perhaps give you a little grin along the way.




### View Information

#### A.  Plugin Settings Page

Plugin Settings can be accessed via Settings > Click Points.

The Settings Page is a list of checkboxes, letting you choose which Events you would like to display in the Click Points Widget. That's it!  Keep in mind, the main purpose of this Page is to display the author's ability to use the WP Settings API.

#### B. Click Points Widget

The Click Points Widget fires all of the action for this plugin.  When activated in a sidebar, it provides an interface for users to click to earn Points toward Rewards (See Rewards Shortcode, below).

#### C.  User Points Shortcode
	
This Shortcode displays a user's points earned, as well as what Events they have clicked to earn points.  

#### D.  Rewards Shortcode

This Shortcode renders Rewards to be purchased with Points.  



### Setup Instructions

#### 1.  Install/Activate Click Points Plugin

#### 2.  Customize Plugin Settings

#### 3.  Activate Click Points Widget

#### 4.  Create User Points Page with Shortcode

Create a Page (I recommend titling it "User Points") and use the [click-points] shortcode.

#### 5.  Create Rewards Page with Shortcode

Create a Page (I recommend titling it "Rewards") and use the [click-points-rewards] shortcode.

#### 6.  Enjoy!

Start using Click Points by clicking on the buttons in the Click Points Widget. Each click will generate a fun little message about how you just earned your points.  

Check on your progress by visiting your User Points Shortcode Page.

Cash in your Points for Rewards on your Rewards Shortcode Page.  These Rewards will be reflected on the User Points Shortcode Page, under "Recent Points".
